            that is a genuine bug in the validator, you must acknowledge that bug in the memo that
            accompanies your project, and point to the relevant documentation, such as
            specifications or an existing reputable bug report, that your source is in fact correct.

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, you may revise either your Project 1 or Project 2 (not both) in to
          improve your project and raise your grade. If you submit the complete deliverables (see
          below) for your revision, you will automatically receive the 10 points for Project 4. Your
          grade for Project 1 or 2 will improve, based on the requirements for those projects. Your
          grade will for the project will not be any lower than what you earned originally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students not opting to revise Project 1 or Project 2 will simply receive the same
          percentage of 10 points (Project 4's total) as they received on Project 1 or 2 combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for example, imagine that Student X got 10 points on Project 1 (15 possible points)
          and 18 points on Project 2 (20 possible points), for a total of 80% (28/35). If Student X
          decides not to revise either project, Student X will receive 8 points for Project 4 (80%
          of 10 points), leaving her grade for the class unchanged. However, if Student X submits
          the deliverables for revising Project 1 or 2, she will receive 10 points for Project 4,
          plus any additional points for the improvements made for the project she revised.
